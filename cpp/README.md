# Reduced-Order-Binary-Decision-Diagrams
C++ Implementation of reduced order binary decision diagram data structure

A binary decision diagram (BDD) is a data structure that is used to represent a Boolean function. The basic idea from which the data structure was created is the Shannon expansion. A switching function is split into two sub-functions (cofactors) by assigning one variable.
